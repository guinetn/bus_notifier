# CHANGELOG

<!--
Read this section if it's your first time writing changelog, if not read anyway.

Guidelines:
- Don't dump commit log diffs as changelogs. Bad idea, it is.
- Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
- There should be an entry for every single version.
- The same types of changes should be grouped.
- the latest version comes first.

Tags:
- Added: for new features.
- Changed: for changes in existing functionality.
- Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features.
- Removed: for now removed features.
- Fixed: for any bug fixes.
- Security: in case of vulnerabilities.

Good to have: commit or PR links.
